team_model_designation: primary
methods: Agent-based microsimulation model
model_details:
 modeling_NPI: NPI as represented through the input parameter to the model controlling intensity of infection kernels
 compliance_NPI: NPI as represented through the input parameter to the model controlling intensity of infection kernels
 contact_tracing: input parameter to the model understood as a probability that any of secondary infected persons for a positively tested individual will be detected
 testing: input parameter to the model understood as a probability that given infected person will be tested positively
 vaccine_efficacy_transmission: vaccine can protects from infection and from severe progression / death
 vaccine_efficacy_delay: no delay
 vaccine_hesitancy: vaccinations in model distributed among agents consistently with official data for age groups
 vaccine_immunity_duration: waning function based on empirical data / scenario constraints
 natural_immunity_duration: waning function based on empirical data / scenario constraints
 case_fatality_rate: age dependend, empirical data based
 infection_fatality_rate: age dependend, empirical data based
 asymptomatics: age dependend
 age_groups: one-year
 importations: Can be defined explicitly as input to the model. Available options include 1) InstantOutsideCases (constant number of imports at a given time), 2) CyclicOutsideCases (constant number of imports during the specified period and with a specified frequency). Each of the importations events include the variant type.
 confidence_interval_method: Samples based
 calibration: Grid search samples around most likely points fitted to last 4 weeks of observed values
 spatial_structure: Not applicable

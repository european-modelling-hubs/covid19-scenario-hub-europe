team_model_designation: primary
methods: OpenCOVID is an invidual-based stochastic discrete-time model of SARS-CoV-2 tranmission and COVID-19 disease dynamics.
methods_long: 'xxx'
model_details:
  modeling_NPI: Isolation utlized for submission, but model is capable of executing other NPIs.
  compliance_NPI: "Not explictly modelled"
  contact_tracing: "Not explictly modelled"
  testing: "Individuals can be tested, diagnosed, and can enter isolation for a given period with a given delay. For this application we assumed testing rates of 1% without symtptoms and 10% with symptoms."
  vaccine_efficacy_transmission: Assumed the proportion of efficacy (0.85) that blocks infection is 0.8
  vaccine_efficacy_delay: "We assume peak efficacy is reached immideatly after the final dose of primary vaccination."
  vaccine_hesitancy: "Not explictly modelled"
  vaccine_immunity_duration: Aassumed to wane following an inverse logistic curve but with an upper bound of 0.85, lower bound of 0.10, slope of 1.8, and a half-life of 70 days.
  natural_immunity_duration: Assumed to wane following an inverse logistic curve with an upper bound of 0.95, lower bound of 0.15, slope of 1.8, and a half-life of 105 days. 
  case_fatality_rate: The probability of severe disease is a function of age, current level of acquired immunity, current level of vaccine-indiced immunity
  infection_fatality_rate: Age related probability given a person is critical; logistic with upper bound of 2, lower bound of 9, half life of 90, and slope of 14.
  asymptomatics: Assumed to be 33% of those infected.
  age_groups: [5-17, 18-59, 60+]
  importations: Assume 1.5 importated infections per day per 100,000 people
  confidence_interval_method: xxx
  calibration: Calibrated at the national-level using epidemioloical data to match 4 metrics (daily confirmed cases, deaths, hospital admissions, and ICU admissions) using a Gaussian Process and Latin Hypercube sampling. 
  spatial_structure: Not applicable
data_inputs: "Cases, deaths, hospitlisations, and icu admission data provided by European Center for Disease Control"

team_model_designation: primary
methods: Agent-based simulation model for COVID-19 based on a traffic simulation and mobile phone data
model_details:
  modeling_NPI: Masks are worn on public transport, increased ventilation rate in schools compared to pre-pandemic behaviour, mobile phone data still shows a slight reduction in amount of time spent outside one's own home. This reduction is transferred to the activity levels in our model.
  compliance_NPI: For masks on public transport we assume a 50% compliance, half of these wear a medical, half of these wear a FFP2 mask. For the venitalation rate we assume that windows are opened every 90 minutes.
  contact_tracing: Contact tracing with minimal capacity and 50% success rate.
  testing: No mandatory testing considered. Agents voluntarily perform one rapid antigen test every 2 weeks before a leisure activity.
  vaccine_efficacy_transmission: Model vaccine efficacy is via our antibody model, which is built upon http://DOI.org/10.1056/NEJMc2119236 and http://DOI.org/10.1056/NEJMc2201607
  vaccine_efficacy_delay: Not applicable
  vaccine_hesitancy: No hesitancy integrate, but vaccination rates are based on vaccination numbers provided by RKI for the following age groups [5-11, 12-17, 18-59, 60+]
  vaccine_immunity_duration: We assume an exponential decay rate (of antibody levels) with a half life of 60 days.
  natural_immunity_duration: Waning occurs with the same rate as for vaccine induced immunity.
  case_fatality_rate: Not applicable
  infection_fatality_rate: Not applicable
  asymptomatics: A rate of 0.2
  age_groups: Agents can have any age between 0 and 99, but certain parameters and analyses employ different binning systems based on the available data.
  importations: Based on disease import for 2021. Numbers were provided by the public health authorities in Cologne.
  confidence_interval_method: Not applicable
  calibration: Calibration against case numbers and shares of different VOCs.
  spatial_structure: Home and activity locations of agents are simulated using transportation model MATSim (http://matsim.org); in Episim these contact locations are simulated as containers with activity specific parameters.

team_model_designation: primary
methods: Deterministic, age-structured SEIR model, accounting for differences in susceptibility/infectiousness by age, seasonality, contact patterns, modes of vaccine protection, and waning immunity.
model_details:
  modeling_NPI: The model uses different contact matrices from the Pienter Corona Study (https://www.rivm.nl/pienter-corona-studie) estimated throughout 2020 and 2021 to approximate contact patterns under different levels of non-pharmaceutical interventions within and between age groups.
  compliance_NPI: Not applicable
  contact_tracing: Not applicable
  testing: Not applicable
  vaccine_efficacy_transmission: Depends on age, vaccine product, and dose
  vaccine_efficacy_delay: Depends on vaccine product and dose but between 7-28 days.
  vaccine_hesitancy: Not applicable
  vaccine_immunity_duration: 'We assume vaccine effectiveness (VE) against transmission and infection wanes following a logistic curve parameterized such that VE decreases by 25 percentage points within the first 6 months after vaccination (Higdon et al. 2022). We assume VE against hospitalisation also wanes following a logistic curve, but at a slower rate than VE against infection and transmission, specifically, that VE decreases by 10 percentage points in the first 6 months following vaccination (Higdon et al. 2022).'
  natural_immunity_duration: We assume natural immunity wanes by 60% after 8 months and follows an Erlang distribution.
  case_fatality_rate: Not applicable
  infection_fatality_rate: Depends on age and vaccination status
  asymptomatics: Not applicable
  age_groups: '[0-9, 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80+]'
  importations: Not included in this submission round, but model does allows for the specification of case importation rate
  confidence_interval_method: Quantiles from multiple simulations
  calibration: The baseline (non-seasonal) transmission rate and initial conditions for forward simulations are calibrated by fitting the model to daily confirmed cases from the national notification database Osiris. The model is fitted to data piecewise to correspond with the correct contact patterns associated with different non-pharmaceutical interventions within each time window.
  spatial_structure: Not applicable

methods_long: We developed a deterministic age-structured compartmental SEIR model extended to include states for severe disease outcomes and vaccination status. The population is partitioned into 10-year age groups (0-9, 10-19, …, 70-79, 80+). The model is designed to incorporate a single vaccine product that 1) reduces susceptibility to infection, 2) reduces risk of hospitalization if a vaccinated individual is infected, and 3) reduces risk of infecting others (transmission) if a vaccinated person is infected. When a person is vaccinated, they first enter a hold state where they are vaccinated, but not yet (fully) protected. After a delay period, they enter the vaccinated and protected state for the dose they have received. We incorporate different vaccine products by taking the daily weighted average of the number of people with each vaccine product (and dose), the corresponding delay to protection of each vaccine product, and the vaccine effectiveness against each outcome. Vaccine-induced protection is assumed to wane following a logistic function parameterized so that after 6 months vaccine-induced protection is reduced by 50% and reduced by 100% after 1 year. Natural immunity is assumed to wane following an Erlang distribution. The model uses different contact matrices from the Pienter Corona Study (https://www.rivm.nl/pienter-corona-studie) estimated throughout 2020 and 2021 to approximate contact patterns under different levels of non-pharmaceutical interventions within and between age groups. These contact matrices are converted to transmission matrices by multiplying rows and columns by estimates of the relative susceptibility and infectiousness of each age group compared to the 0-9 years age group. To account for the seasonal pattern of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we define the transmission rate at time t as a sinusoidal function of seasonality as in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.110874.

team_model_designation: primary
methods: Stochastic age-structured discrete time extended compartmental model
team_funding: This project received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant number 101003688 – EpiPose project).
repo_url: https://github.com/lwillem/stochastic_model_BE
data_inputs: The model uses hospitalisation, mortality and serological data, as provided by the Belgian Scientific Institute for Public Health, Sciensano. Social contact data are provided by the CoMix project.
citation: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2021.100449
methods_long: Several details and updates of the model and previous forecasts are presented in different technical reports at https://covid-en-wetenschap.github.io
model_details:
  modeling_NPI: NPI are modelled using CoMix social contact data collected every 2 weeks and additional age-specific proportionality factors detecting the transmission
  compliance_NPI: Compliance to the intervention measures taken is assumed to be gradual over 5 days
  contact_tracing: Not applicable
  testing: Not applicable
  vaccine_efficacy_transmission: We use a “leaky” vaccination approach. For example, vaccination with 50% effectiveness, implies that for a vaccinated individual the likelihood to acquire infection is 50% less compared to a non-vaccinated individual of the same age. The levels of protection against infection and hospital admissions after infection for different VOCs are presented in Page 5 Table 1 of https://covid-en-wetenschap.github.io/assets/20220415_technical_note_SIMID.pdf
  vaccine_efficacy_delay: Vaccine-induced immunity against infection is implemented as a step function with a switch from, e.g., 0% to 50% protection against infection 21 days after the first vaccine dose. Vaccine-induced protection against hospital admission is implemented incrementally on top of the protection against infection. Protection induced by the second and booster vaccine doses is assumed to be achieved fully (i.e., depending on the maximal vaccine effectiveness) 7 days after administration.
  vaccine_hesitancy: Not applicable, uptake based on reported data
  vaccine_immunity_duration: Waning as in scenarios, using exponential law
  natural_immunity_duration: 100% protection vs infection just after recovery, with waning as in scenarios using exponential law
  case_fatality_rate: Not applicable, the model is not based on confirmed cases
  infection_fatality_rate: Calibrated
  asymptomatics: Calibrated
  age_groups: 10 years age groups
  importations: No importation, except a seed for each new variant
  confidence_interval_method: Samples coming from independent MCMC chains, plus stochastic realisation on transmissions
  calibration: MCMC Random-Walk Metropolis algorithm performed on a deterministic version of the model
  spatial_structure: Not applicable

(working title) Information loss due to categorising uncertainty in epidemic modelling

Aims:
To demonstrate what information is lost in the process of summarising model output in quantiles when contributing to a multi-model epidemic modelling hub, in terms of:

- Key epidemic characteristics
- Summarising uncertainty using an ensemble
- Exploring performance against observed data

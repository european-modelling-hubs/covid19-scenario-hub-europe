model_details:
  modeling_NPI: In this simulation we consider use of facemasks. With no changing conditions in their use for the period between March 13th 2022 and March 7th  2022
  compliance_NPI: We assume that the NPI do not change during the period from March 2022 to March 2023
  contact_tracing: We consider that a certain percentage of the infected individuals are self-quarantined at home.
  testing: Not considered for this version of the code (we will include it in future versions)
  vaccine_efficacy_transmission: The vaccine efficacy depends on the number of doses, the virus variant and its related immunity is also subjected to waning.
  vaccine_efficacy_delay: For Pfizer we consider, for the second doses and boosters, that after vaccination the maximum immunity is reached after 7 days. Then, it remains steady for 30 days and following this, it decreases following a gamma distribution.
  vaccine_hesitancy: First and second doses = Children 47%, Adults 16%, Elderly people 4%; Booster = Children 100%, Adults 60%, Elderly people 10%
  vaccine_immunity_duration: 30 days after the dose, then waning following a gamma distribution
  natural_immunity_duration: 30 days after infection or (if the individual was already infected) after the vaccination, then waning following a gamma distribution
  case_fatality_rate: Age-dependant values and dependent on whether the individual has acquired immunity. Not subjected to waning.
  infection_fatality_rate: Age-dependant values and dependent on whether the individual has acquired immunity. Not subjected to waning.
  asymptomatics: We assume that 25% of the infected are asymptomatic
  age_groups: 0-5, 6-10, 10-15, 15-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-70, 80-90, 90-100+
  importations: We use data provided the by Spanish National Health service. We scale the detected cases in order to estimate the real ones.
  confidence_interval_method: Based on calibration and statistical analysis of multiple executions.
  calibration: We calibrate the model using the time interval from July 2021 and March 2022
  spatial_structure: 10 cities, 5,018,260 inhabitants.
